🛡️ DesignGuard – Bookmarkable UX Linter for Design System Violations
📌 Overview
DesignGuard is a lightweight, no-install UX linter built for secure enterprise environments where browser extensions are blocked. It allows developers to define custom design rules and generate a bookmarklet script that highlights violations in any live web application. It works with any design system—SALT UI, Material UI, Bootstrap, or custom.

🎯 Problem Statement
Developers often unintentionally misuse design system components or violate UX guidelines due to a lack of real-time feedback.

🔒 In highly regulated environments, browser extensions are blocked—making it difficult to detect UX inconsistencies early in the development lifecycle.

💡 Solution Summary
DesignGuard provides a developer-centric way to lint the UI in real-time without relying on external tools or installations:

Define rules visually (e.g., button:not([aria-label]) → “Missing ARIA label”)

Generate a self-contained JavaScript bookmarklet

Click the bookmark on any internal app → get real-time violation highlights and tooltips
